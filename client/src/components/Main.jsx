          <p>Now Joe Rogan isn’t quite lying—he is saying what he assumes is true. He’s heard of supposedly early supposedly hominin fossils, how they are related, how they must have geneticly diverged, and how evolution should affect the geno- and phenotypes, so he assumes that the finding of bones of something like “Lucy” and the publishing of a theory of such a creature’s life and date must come as well with its genome and the theoretical cornucopia of corroborating data.

            After all, it’s hard to visit a friend’s house without leaving DNA behind. Certainly having “Lucy’s” bones means we have her genome sequenced. Can’t they just dig into her marrow? If scientists can find out who you’re related to by your DNA, or find a criminal based on DNA, certainly they should be able to show the relative descent of creatures on earth!

            The reality is that not only that genomics is much more complicated than that, but also that DNA just doesn’t last that long. Supposed early hominids (or any creature) have no DNA remaining whatsoever, let alone a full genome (which I suppose I should say is not the same thing).

            So why do we think Lucy is what we think it is? Well, we have a theory of species and their origins and its apparent traits fit in a well-wanted place.

            Just Imagine the Science
            My point here is not narrowly about evolution or creationism.

            The point is that when we are brought up in a wider mindset of science, when we hear about a theory of how the world works, and see that there are trained authorities that say what kind of evidence we should expect, we naturally fill in the gaps and assume that work has been done to complete satisfaction.

            Joe Rogan here is doing what we all do. He knows that the ideas of common ancestry, genetics, evolution and others will predict very specific things about the world. He also knows that theoretically we should have tools to find this information

            “What do you mean you guess? It either is or it isn’t.”

            “Will you calm down? How the hell are they gonna know anyway? You seen one ugly little baldy, you’ve seen ‘em all. All babies look the same.”
            “Not the elven ones.”
            “Enough with your elf fetish. These babies are all under the care of the Empire anyway, they’re here for the taking.
            “Yeah, the key word being the Empire. You know we need the proper paper work, which you just fucking lost!”
            “So what, I can forge it. You really worry too much, there’s so much red tape they ain’t gonna know the difference and what does it matter? The Empire’s getting a body for their purposes anyway.”
